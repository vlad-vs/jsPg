react =>
    - установка глобальной версии => npm install -g create-react-app
    - создать проект => create-react-app my-table

==>
			  inside that directory, you can run several commands:

			  npm start
			    Starts the development server.

			  npm run build
			    Bundles the app into static files for production.

			  npm test
			    Starts the test runner.

			  npm run eject
			    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
			    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

			We suggest that you begin by typing:

			  cd my-table
			  npm start

			Happy hacking!
